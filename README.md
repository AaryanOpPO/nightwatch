## Background

Nightwatch started as a tiny bot for a single Discord server. Over the years, it has transformed and scaled to work in any server. It has been through several rewrites, and has evolved in performance, functionality, and design.

### Why was this bot created?

I created this bot to eliminate how many bots you use in your server. Having several bots makes your server look unprofessional and gives users the feeling that the bots are the only good thing about the server.

I wanted to make a bot that combines all the popular features from the other bots into a single bot. Bots should compliment your server, not control it.

Lastly, I wanted to introduce a bot that was professionally designed, using enterprise design patterns and a highly scalable architecture. Compared to other bots, Nightwatch is built for scale with industry standards to back its design. It was intended to be a commercial application, but was open sourced to show off its clean code and prove its abilities.
